    "description": "Nakajima Atsushi was kicked out of his orphanage, and now he has no place to go and no food. While he is standing by a river, on the brink of starvation, he rescues a man whimsically attempting suicide. That man is Dazai Osamu, and he and his partner Kunikida are members of a very special detective agency. They have supernatural powers and deal with cases that are too dangerous for the police or the military. They're tracking down a tiger that has appeared in the area recently, around the time Atsushi came to the area. The tiger seems to have a connection to Atsushi, and by the time the case is solved, it is clear that Atsushi's future will involve much more of Dazai and the rest of the detectives! (Source: MangaHelpers) Episode 1 will be previewed at an event at Marunouchi Piccadilly on March 27, 2016. Episodes 1 and 2 will be previewed at Yokohama Burg 13 on April 2, 2016.

    "description": "What's a hero? For Izuku Midoriya, the answer to that question has always been simple: \"Everything I want to be!\" And who is the ultimate hero? Well, the legendary All Might, of course. All Might is the number one ranked hero and also the \"Symbol of Peace\" in the world. Not in his wildest dreams could Izuku have imagined that he would soon cross paths with his childhood hero... In Boku no Hero Academia, status is governed by \"Quirks\"â€”unique superpowers which develop in childhood. But, unfortunately, hero otaku Midoriya \"Deku\" Izuku never had a Quirk. That is, until he met All Might, the greatest hero of all time. Izuku's transformation from dreamer to superhero begins at Yuuei Academy, the top-ranked hero-training high school in Japan. Izuku is on cloud nine when he's accepted to this prestigious academy, especially when he finds out that All Might is one of the teachers. What surprises does this mighty academy offer? And will Izuku be able to keep up with his elite classmates?",
