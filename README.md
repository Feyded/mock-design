# Welcome!

Hello! My name is **Dean Zallero**, and this is my technical hands-on exam.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository or extract the respository**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev

If all assets do not load, simply refresh the page.

Thank you for the opportunity
